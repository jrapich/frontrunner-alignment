# What problem does this solve?

I have a list of railroad milepost coordinates in several JSON files. I will use this tool to convert them to a .kml file that is then usable/importable into a google maps/google earth project I am working on. 

.kml file is the format for use in google maps/earth projects, that list points/overlays/lines/objects etc on top of a google map/earth map/ by converting these railroad gps coordinates into a useable .kml file, I can then easily import them into my google maps project.
